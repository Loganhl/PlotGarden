            <p>People all accross the United States struggle with a massive problem, food deserts.
                This is an area in which a community finds it difficult to buy affordable or good- quality fresh food.
                Nutrition and our diets contribute to many problems that our nation is facing as they impact nearly every
                aspect of our physcial and mental lives.
            </p>
            <h3>We want to help tackle this problem!</h3>
            <p>We created a highly accessible and interactive website that guides a user
                through the steps of creating a garden from start to finish. 
                We placed our main efforts in collecting data from multiple sourcces 
                and not only combining it into user-friendly data, but also presenting users with
                a plotting of their garden based on their entered metrics such as garden location and size.
            </p>
            <h3>Getting Started:</h3>
